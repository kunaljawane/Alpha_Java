Access modifier:
    public:accesible everywhere
    private:accesible only within the class and not to package
    protected:accesible to class and within the package
    
getter function- function that used to get the value 
                 function that return the value
Setter function- function that used to set the value
                 function that give the value to any variable

Four pillar of oops:
1]Encapsulation
    Wrapping of data and methods into the single unit
    also implements the data hiding
2]Abstraction
    hiding the unnecessary part and showing only needed
3}Polymorphism
    function overloading
    function overriding
4]Inheritance
    multiple is not supported 

Constructor:
 It is the special function that used to initialize variable  
 has no return type
 can be called automatically only once
 has same name as the class
 in java if we dont decalre the constructor then it automatically makes the constructor
 but only difference it it cant initialize the value

Types of constructor:
 if the program has many constructor then know as the constructor overloading(different parms)
 which is the type of Polymorphism
1-Non-parmeterized
2-parmeterized
3-copy constructor:
    if we want to copy the properties of one object to the other

Destuctor:
in java we dont declare the Destuctor it automatically desrtucted by the garbage collector


Inhertance:
properties of base class in passed to the derived class
parent clss ==> child class

Types:
1-single level inheritance-
 one derived class extends one base class
2-Multi level inheritance-
 more than two classed
3-Hierarchical
 many classed derive from the one base class
4-Hybrid
 combination of every type of inheritance

Abstract class
 you have to write Abstract in from of class
 it can contain abstarct or non abstarct methods
 we cant create the object of the abstarct class
 it can have constructor-
  to initialize the variable for the child class
  the class which is declared first can give the output

Inteface:
 is a blue print of class
 used to implements muliple inheritance
 c extends b extends abstarct
 used to implements total Abstraction
 defined by the keyword Inteface 
 Inteface methods are public and abstarct and can be implements
 variable in the Inteface can be public static and final

static keyword;
 static-constant that cant be change for the different objectwe 
 we can make properties function block of code static
 also nested class can be made static
 main function is static because we want to create only one main function
 avoid the multiple creation

Super:
 use to refer to the immmediate parent class object
 to access the properties function and constructor of parent class

class cant be private and protected then it become inaccesible
it can be only public and default

car c(Refernce )=new car() (object)

we can crate the child object with the parent Refernce but cant be create parents object with child Refernce

nested class also know as the aggregation
